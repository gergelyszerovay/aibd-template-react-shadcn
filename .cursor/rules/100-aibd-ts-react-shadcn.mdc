# AIBD TypeScript Coding Guidelines

## React Radix UI and Shadcn Guidelines

This rule defines how to use and extend shadcn UI components in AIBD React projects.

### Component Installation
- All shadcn UI components are already installed in the codebase and available for import from the `@/components/ui` directory.
- Do not re-install or duplicate shadcn components. Use the provided versions.

### Importing shadcn Components
- Always import shadcn UI components from the `@shared/shadcn-ui` directory using path aliases.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from "@shared/shadcn-ui/button";
  import { Input } from "@shared/shadcn-ui/input";
  ```
- Do not import directly from the `shadcn-ui` or `@radix-ui` packages in feature or app code.

### Usage Guidelines
- Use shadcn UI components as the primary building blocks for UI in features and shared components.
- Compose shadcn components with Tailwind CSS utility classes for custom styling.
- Do not modify the core shadcn component files directly. If you need to extend or override a component, create a wrapper or extension in your feature's `internal/` directory or in `shared/ui` if it is to be shared.
- All custom UI components should follow the same API and accessibility patterns as shadcn components.

### Accessibility
- All UI components (including custom extensions) must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- Use shadcn's built-in accessibility features and extend them as needed for your use case.

### Enforcement
- Code reviews must verify that only the pre-installed shadcn UI components are used and imported correctly.
- Any new shared UI components must be placed in `shared/ui` and follow shadcn conventions.
- Do not bypass or duplicate shadcn UI components in feature code.
